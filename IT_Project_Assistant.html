        <h2>1. MyEOIS Website Enhancement</h2>
        <p>During my summer internship as an IT Project Assistant at the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, I played a role in managing and enhancing the The Employment Ontario Information System (MyEOIS) government website, which is responsible for supporting the administration of Employment Ontario programs and services.
            
            I actively engaged with the existing codebase, closely observing and analyzing the PHP and JavaScript code. This not only expanded my technical knowledge but also provided me with fresh perspectives on efficient coding practices.
            
            One of my key responsibilities was to identify and resolve errors or bugs within the website. Additionally, I undertook the task of developing new functionalities, such as the "Add more files" and "Select Agents" features, seamlessly integrating them into the existing codebase. This hands-on experience enabled me to fine-tune my coding skills while contributing to the site's overall usability.

            One of the distinctive aspects of my role was my involvement in regular meetings, where I reported on the issues I had resolved and the enhancements I had implemented. These meetings occurred twice a week, providing an opportunity for me to communicate my progress to the team effectively and ensure transparency in the development process. This reporting process not only enhanced team collaboration but also facilitated effective tracking of project milestones.

            After reviewing, I diligently transferred tickets to other agents for review, ensuring that each issue was thoroughly examined and fully resolved. This collaborative approach to ticket management allowed for an efficient resolution process, minimizing delays and maximizing productivity.
            
            One notable challenge I encountered during this process was the initial difficulty in running a heavy platform, Docker Engine. Understanding the workflow, working within a local environment, and successfully pushing changes to the staging environment posed a steep learning curve. Moreover, I encountered numerous new terminologies in the workspace that I had not encountered in my educational background.
            
            To overcome these challenges, I proactively sought assistance from my senior colleagues and peers. I was not afraid to ask for help and actively engaged in researching and learning the intricacies of programming within the workplace. This commitment allowed me to conquer these hurdles and further develop my skills, ultimately contributing to the success of the MyEOIS website project.  This role allowed me to gain invaluable insights into web development, teamwork, and communication.</p>

        <h2>2. AI-Based Resume Sorting System</h2>
        <p>A significant highlight of my role was the development of a cutting-edge AI-based resume sorting system to create a sophisticated tool that would revolutionize the recruitment process.

          One of the key milestones of this project was the deployment of a dedicated website that hosted the resume sorting AI as its backend. This strategic decision allowed us to streamline recruitment procedures and significantly enhance the evaluation of candidates. To achieve this, I utilized a combination of React and Vita, carefully crafting a user-friendly and efficient interface that complemented the power of the AI-driven sorting system.
          
          However, this endeavor was not without its challenges. One of the primary obstacles we faced was the selection of the right technologies and services for deployment. Our team extensively considered various options, including Google Firebase, GitHub, and more. Each platform presented its unique set of advantages and limitations, and it was crucial to ensure that our chosen platform supported the necessary dependencies and databases.
          
          Overcoming this challenge required a blend of technical expertise and effective communication within the team. As my experience in web development, AI, and database management grew, I became increasingly proficient in making informed decisions about technology selection. Ultimately, after careful consideration and collaborative discussions with team members, we settled on Netlify as the ideal platform to deploy the website and the resume sorting AI. This decision streamlined our development process and ensured the seamless operation of the system.
          
          The successful implementation of the AI-Based Resume Sorting System not only demonstrated my technical prowess but also highlighted my ability to navigate complex technological choices through teamwork and the guidance of senior colleagues. This project stands as a testament to our commitment to innovation and efficiency within the Ministry of Transportation.</p>
