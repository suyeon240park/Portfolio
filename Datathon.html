        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Toronto Health Datathon is an event with the goal of applying artificial intelligence to address real-world challenges within the Canadian healthcare system. Participants work collaboratively to analyze healthcare data sets and develop innovative solutions using the given datasets.</p>
        <p class="link">For more information about this event, please click <a href="https://datathon.healthdatanexus.ai/">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Our team utilized Python in Google Colab to create a linear regression model. The main objective was to predict a patient's race and ethnicity based on SaO2 and SpO2.</p>
        <p>SaO2: the oxygen saturation of arterial blood measured by blood gas analysis.</p>
        <p>SpO2: the oxygen saturation of arterial blood detected by the pulse oximeter.</p>
        <p>Pulse oximeters are devices that measure oxygen levels using infrared light in the fingertip and they tend to overestimate oxygen levels in individuals with darker skin due to light absorption differences. This can result in a racial and ethnic bias in SpO2 readings compared to SaO2.</p>

        <p>Predicting race and ethicity of a patient from the difference between SaO2 and SpO2 is significant for the analysis of health disparities among different racial groups and the concise measurement of the oxygen level in blood of each patient.</p>
        <p>Our team trained a linear regression model, refining it to effectively address these biases. This process involved identifying patterns and relationships within the data to make accurate predictions.</p>
        <img src="assets/images/datathon.jpg">
        <p>We had the opportunity to present our findings and model to audience, which included healthcare professionals and data science experts. The presentation highlighted the model's logic and its potential applications in healthcare scenarios.</p>
        <p>As a result, our team secured 2nd place in the datathon.</p>
        <p>Through this event, I learned the existing biases in the medical field and the way to effectively utilize them to advance the healthcare system. I also gained practical knowledge in constructing machine learning models using provided datasets, which greatly improved my technical skills.</p>
