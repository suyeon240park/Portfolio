        <h2>1. MyEOIS Website Enhancement</h2>
        <p>During my tenure as an IT Project Assistant at the Ontario Ministry of Transportation, I played a pivotal role in managing and enhancing the MyEOIS website from the staff's perspective. This role allowed me to gain invaluable insights into web development, particularly in the realms of PHP and JavaScript.
            
            I actively engaged with the existing codebase, closely observing and analyzing the PHP and JavaScript code. This not only expanded my technical knowledge but also provided me with fresh perspectives on efficient coding practices.
            
            One of my key responsibilities was to identify and resolve errors or bugs within the website. Additionally, I undertook the task of introducing new functionalities, such as the "Add more files" and "Select Agents" features, seamlessly integrating them into the existing codebase. This hands-on experience enabled me to fine-tune my coding skills while contributing to the site's overall usability.
            
            One notable challenge I encountered during this process was the initial difficulty in running the software Docker. Understanding the workflow, working within a local environment, and successfully pushing changes to the staging environment posed a steep learning curve. Moreover, I encountered numerous new terminologies in the workspace that I had not encountered in my educational background.
            
            To overcome these challenges, I proactively sought assistance from my senior colleagues and peers, fostering a collaborative environment where knowledge sharing was encouraged. I was not afraid to ask for help and actively engaged in researching and learning the intricacies of programming within the workplace. This determination and commitment allowed me to conquer these hurdles and further develop my skills, ultimately contributing to the success of the MyEOIS website project.
            
            This updated description provides a more detailed account of your experiences and challenges while working on the MyEOIS website, highlighting your proactive approach to problem-solving and continuous learning.</p>

        <h2>2. Resume Seleting AI and its website</h2>
        <p>I have worked on various engineering and non-engineering projects, both individually and collaboratively. Toronto Health Datathon and Optimization of the Flow of Ambulatory Patients are one of the best experiences I had ever in my university life. Independently, I worked to create this fancy portfolio website (very fancy! isn't it?). Nowadays, I am developing an ML model that analyzes the Toronto Housing Market and predicts the profits from marketing the house. For more details on these projects, please refer to the "Projects" section in my portfolio.</p>

        <h2>3. IAST Logo Design Contest</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I love nothing more than losing myself in a good book and discovering new knowledge. Getting out into nature is another way I find solace and renewal. Hiking through beautiful landscapes with my loved ones is one of my favorite ways to connect with the world around me. And when life gets tough, it's the strength and support I receive from them that keeps me going on my journey through life.</p>
